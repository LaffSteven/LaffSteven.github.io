"Hello, IT. Have you tried turning it off and on again?"

Yeah, I know, not an original quote. But I’ve used it enough.

I’ve been working in Desktop Support since 2012 and, honestly, I like the job. But after a certain amount of time it can get to be a bit repetitive. So, I started thinking about career advancement, and what I would need to do in order to achieve that: First thing to do was start researching which certifications would be needed. Then figure amount the amount of time it would take to get all of that learning and testing done. Finally, calculate the cost of the whole ordeal. The answer was not thrilling.

Then I thought of my friend who had just recently changed careers after finishing a coding bootcamp. Doing the research on some of those programs was the next logical step. There were some other considerations as well. Software Engineers had a significantly higher pay ceiling than Desktop Support Technicians. The work can be much more intellectually challenging. You also develop the skillset to think about the world in a new and interesting way. Ultimately, Flatiron School, the same place my friend went looked like the best choice. So, here we are writing a blog to chronicle our trip through this coding adventure together.

I look forward to keeping you updated on my progress here. We’ll also be talking about other fun and interesting technology and tech news!
