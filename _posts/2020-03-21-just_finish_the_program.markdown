Working on this latest portfolio project took much longer than might have. The culprit? Feature Creep.

I would sit down to write the program and then find myself 45 minutes later fiddling around in the CSS instead of actually figuring out why I can't change the age of a registered pet...

I started on this project with a plan to register a user, and have some pets belong to them. Then, somewhere along the line, I was working out how to have three different types of user with the ability to do different things, and a system for making appointments.

All features that are beyond the requirements of the project, and making me stress over tying them in, and certain features not working. I had to force myself to take a break and re-assess the project. Then take alook and just re-plan to fullfill the requirements. 

Using a whiteboard to clearly list the tasks I need to fullfill the rquirements of the project. Check off each task as you go, and when you have a bright idea for a new feature...look at the checklist on the whiteboard, and if it's not completed, make a note of the feature and just keep checking off boxes.
